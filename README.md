Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression in Machine Learning
📌 Introduction

In Machine Learning, regression techniques are widely used for predicting continuous values. However, when datasets contain multicollinearity or require feature selection, traditional Linear Regression may not perform well.
To overcome these issues, regularization techniques such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net are applied.

🔹 1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

Definition: Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients (L2 norm).

Cost Function:
𝐽(𝜃)=MSE+𝜆∑𝑗=1𝑛𝜃𝑗2
J(θ)=MSE+λ
j=1∑nθj2
	​


Effect:

Shrinks coefficients but does not eliminate them.

Useful for handling multicollinearity.

When to Use: When most features are expected to be useful.

🔹 2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

Definition: Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of coefficients (L1 norm).

Cost Function:

𝐽(𝜃)=MSE+𝜆∑𝑗=1𝑛∣𝜃𝑗∣
J(θ)=MSE+λ
j=1∑n​∣θj∣

Effect:

Can shrink some coefficients to zero.

Performs feature selection automatically.

When to Use: When we suspect only a few features are important.

🔹 3. Elastic Net Regression

Definition: Combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.

Cost Function:

𝐽(𝜃)=MSE+𝛼[𝜆1∑∣𝜃𝑗∣+𝜆2∑𝜃𝑗2]
J(θ)=MSE+α[λ1∑∣θj∣+λ2∑θj2]

Effect:

Balances between Ridge and Lasso.

Useful when there are many correlated features.

When to Use: When dataset has high dimensionality and we want both feature selection and regularization.


📊 Key Points

Regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

Ridge is good for multicollinearity, Lasso for feature selection, and Elastic Net for balanced scenarios.

Hyperparameter α (lambda) controls the strength of penalty
